The Digital Millennium<br>Copyright Act of 1998 (the &quot;DMCA&quot;) provides recourse for copyright<br>owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their<br>rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials<br>hosted by Crooklyn infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a<br>notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. <br><br><br><br>The notice must include the following<br>information: <br><br><br>i. <br>(i) A physical or electronic<br>signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive<br>right that is allegedly infringed;<br><br><br><br><br>ii. <br>(ii) Identification of the<br>copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted<br>works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a<br>representative list of such works); <br><br><br><br><br>iii. <br>(iii) Identification of the material<br>that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and<br>information reasonably sufficient to allow Crooklyn to locate the material on<br>the Site;<br><br><br><br><br>iv. <br> (iv) The name, address, telephone number and<br>email address (if available) of the complaining party;<br><br><br><br><br>v. <br> (v) A statement that the complaining party has<br>a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not<br>authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and <br><br><br><br><br>vi. <br>(vi) A statement that the information<br>in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the<br>complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive<br>right that is allegedly infringed. Additionally, if you believe in good faith<br>that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by Crooklyn<br>against you, the DMCA permits you to send Crooklyn a counter-notice. <br><br><br><br>Notices and counter-notices must meet<br>the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see<br>http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with<br>respect to the Site should be sent to:<br><br><br><br>Crooklyn Clan Inc.<br><br>91 Broadhollow Road<br><br> Melville, New York 11747<br><br><br><br>We suggest that you consult your<br>legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
